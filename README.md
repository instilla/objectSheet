# objectSheet Library

This library enhances standards GoogleSheet Spreadsheet with powerful database-like features, such as Select, Insert, Update, Delete which can be used in Google Apps Scripts apps. 

Since data stored in the spreadsheet is treated as objects, the library can be used to create powerful models / repository (i.e. to develop modern MVC applications with Google Apps Scripts).

The file demo.gs provides some explanatory examples of the usage of the library.
